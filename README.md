# function

Welcome to the repository of function(), my blog (accessible at https://blog.arash.codes)! function() primarily focuses on sharing code snippets I find useful, experiences that I have gone through, and stories that I wish to share with the world.

The source code features the following tech stack:

|          Technology          | Description of use                                                                                                         |
| :--------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Astro](https://astro.build) | The framework used to power the entire website. It allows you to easily create performant content-driven websites.         |
| [Vercel](https://vercel.com) | The platform used to deploy the website. It allows me to effortlessly publish live changes to the domain at a single push. |

## Motivations

For a while, I have visited the blogs of a few developers who shared interesting solutions to the problems they've faced that I had as well. I was impressed with how each blog was unique to its own self and the developer itself: content-wise, design-wise, and style-wise. In a way, blogs can be used to share more about an individual — not just a developer — through the way they write, design, and plan.

That inspired me to create a blog of my own. Not to mention, embarking on a project like this allowed me to expand my horizons with what I know and learn new things while enjoying the process of learning by doing.
