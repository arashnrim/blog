    <p>Hello internet!</p>
    <p>
      It's pretty weird to think about having a blog today. It's already
      daunting enough to put a piece of yourself online, and it's another thing
      trying to practice the craft of writing live. There's some form of
      permanence in a blog, with scrapers and archivers being out here, but I
      think it's all the more exciting to share my perspective on things and
      have it be a part of the internet. Feel free to read through my posts — in
      a way, they're all tiny fragments that represent a part of me. I hope you
      enjoy them!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also interested in the concept of <strong>digital gardens</strong>.
      I'm still learning more about them now, and I'm hoping to implement my own
      version once I have it down. Feel free to reach out if you're into these
      kinds of things!
