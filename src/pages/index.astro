      <b>Welcome to my corner of the internet!</b> I hope to use this as a place
      for me to share what little I have with the world. Writing is a craft I want
      to continue developing further, and I believe that there is no better way to
      develop the skill than to write. I'm slowly finding my voice and how I approach
      things as I go!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also interested in the concept of <strong>digital gardens</strong>.
      I'm still learning more about them now, and I'm hoping to implement my own
      version once I have it down. Feel free to reach out if you're into these
      kinds of things!
