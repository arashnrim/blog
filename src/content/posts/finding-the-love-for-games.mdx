People say that playing games can sometimes make you feel like a kid again, and I don't disagree with that at all. Even by bringing you back to a time of nostalgic fun, it can leave such a powerful impact on you that it changes you, sometimes for the better (like learning something about yourself) or worse (spiralling into a short-term game addiction). It's the games like these that leave this kind of impact that I love the most.

I like to describe myself as among the most casual of gamers; most games that are popular with my friends don't really interest me, and I struggle to play sometimes with fatigue easily coming not long after I begin playing (usually around half an hour!). There's an exception to this, though, with games that appear to transcend this barrier somehow. Thinking about now about it now, I'm quite intrigued and am interested to learn more about what parts of them speak out to me the most.

Could it be the countless hours spent by the developers to build the worlds I've come to love? Is it the characters in the games, and how they interact with each other and their environments? To me, it feels like one of those things that come intuitively: something (or some things) in the game just _vibe_ well with you, and you grow to love it or them the more you play.

It's hard for me to define what kind of games I love. Simply describing a genre won't do — since I've yet to explore any in great detail — but I can still say that a few stood out to me. More importantly, some might even have left an impact on me, usually emotionally, and challenged me to reflect and change for the better.

It sounds like a far reach saying this — after all, they're just games — but I certainly value the things I take away from the games I've played. On top of that, I really value the emotional impact games can have on me. It can feel like _Schrödinger's emotion_ after finishing a game: when I sit in silence after finishing an impactful game, it can simultaneously feel _meh_ and profound at the same time until I think about it more. That's pretty interesting to me!

Here's a list of games that hav left some form of impact on me. I'm not the best at translating what I feel and think of these games into words on a screen, but I think they're an exciting avenue to describe and discover just what about these games really connects with me. Each of these games are ones that found me at the right time and right headspace to fully enjoy them and what they have to offer.

OMORI hides a deceivingly powerful story so out of left field when you consider its otherwise innocent and happy-go-lucky art style. I doubt that it's a game meant for everyone, especially with the dark themes that lay within (particularly surrounding isolation and psychological responses to past trauma) and the game's plot moving at a snail's pace. It took me a while to push through the first few hours of the game (meant to introduce me to basic mechanics), but it quickly unveiled its true nature, layer by layer, as more of the worlds opened up.

I first played OMORI in 2020, and I can't exactly recall how I came across it to begin with. After finishing it, the game gave me such a deep insight into what it meant to convey such a complicated and morally complex message in the form of game media. I still recall how it felt as I pieced the truth behind the story and its messages together. There's a part in the game where, after many ambiguous moments and vague metaphors (<Spoiler>the SOMETHINGS you see</Spoiler>, the mild jump scares) it suddenly gets straight to the point and lays everything out for you. That abrupt change, to me, captured the essence of the game: storytelling done right.

The most memorable thing that still hits me to this day is OMORI's soundtrack. It ties in so well with the story and it's so powerful that playing a G and then a C major is enough to send memories flooding back and raise the hairs on the back of my neck. If you were listening to the soundtrack with no knowledge whatsoever of the game, you might get surprised at the range of the tracks in the OST. To me, the OST has a mix of everything! These are some of my favourites:

- [_See You Tomorrow_](https://youtu.be/MQYmjpdA_Pw?si=4hhFIL3_6NoECA_D) and [_Crossroads_](https://youtu.be/5s-1dej9Gsc?si=Xh3rEZ3AoZbtfhVM) remind me of sunsets and the warm hug of a time once passed. They share the same motif, but if you consider them in their contexts they are entirely different levels of meaning. I liked what a comment under Crossroad's music video said, and I think it represents both of them aptly:

  > See You Tomorrow mood: Yeah, this was real fun, let's do this tomorrow again!
  >
  > Crossroads mood: I cherish every moment we spend together and I'll miss you a lot until tomorrow.

- [_Friends._](https://youtu.be/FT4cMYqiOng?si=zh_LWCU_TjJ_BAu6) reminded me why this game had a "horror" label to begin with. It starts off exactly the same as its innocent counterpart [_Lost At A Sleepover_](https://youtu.be/hLDull8aPDw?si=q1loNYyMgE9voOta), but quickly diverges to catch you unawares. It makes sense when you consider that it <Spoiler>happens during the BLACK SPACE segment</Spoiler>.

- [_World's End Valentine_](https://youtu.be/rlQd9qWKjLM?si=2MTkAPGSZTYXgMkW) and [_BREADY STEADY GO_](https://youtu.be/QL_MA9kQ-0o?si=EMDpu2DJrgpKbXEc) are absolute _bangers_ and I find myself relistening to them time and again. When playing the game, they make you feel like you're fighting against foes with indomitable spirits and, overall, remind me of a 10/10 gaming moment. Also, have you heard [the orchestral version of WEV](https://youtu.be/OG6HJRpqs_8?si=DWq9VRzn0789UoqT&t=4066)? \*chef's kiss\*

- [_Dear Little Brother..._](https://youtu.be/t3b52Z2qtfw?si=I2dvw0s6eWt1Ko5Y) and [_Remembrance._](https://youtu.be/4f1v9u2Jbg8?si=DomCixYTSQygdEqS) are simply moving. They're placed at just the right time, and every note of their already minimalistic production hits all the more.

Also not to forget are (arguably) the biggest tracks of the game: [_DUET_](https://youtu.be/8ya9EhvcNsA?si=GPgz5hxiWlXa9Gh2) and [_My Time_](https://youtu.be/FdmELnpjTpw?si=1Rh3EfiqkEs97zhl). How the game weaves its soundtrack throughout moments of the game and effortlessly creates strong mental associations between moments should be worthy of scientific research.

I like what [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/s1a2j5/what_makes_final_duet_so_emotional_analysis) had to say about _DUET_. Spoilers ahead!

  We associate this theme <Spoiler title={null} showIcon={false}>not just with Mari and Sunny’s younger life when they were happy before the trauma, but we also associate this song with the time that we start playing the game.</Spoiler> With the story’s climax already tearing at you [sic] heart strings, it goes even further to make it personal. <Spoiler title={null} showIcon={false}>And when you finish the game, hearing a different variation of the theme in the main menu screen, it really emphasizes an end of a difficult journey (consider it an end of the player’s journey) and the beginning of Sunny moving forward.</Spoiler>

With a god-tier soundtrack and meticulously well-paced story, OMORI is one of those games that feels just as harrowing as they are powerful foods for thought. What happened to the characters is a most unfortunate exception in life, but it was interesting to see how their handling of that event shaped the people they eventually will become in the game. It's interesting to see how the game is just as psychological as it is enjoyable, and that's why this game has been on my mind for years now. I only wish that I could play this game for the first time again.
