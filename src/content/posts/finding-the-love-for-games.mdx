People say that playing games can sometimes make you feel like a kid again, and I don't disagree with that at all. Even by bringing you back to a time of nostalgic fun, it can leave such a powerful impact on you that it changes you; whether for the better (like learning something about yourself) or worse (spiralling into a short-term game addiction), it's the games that leave this kind of impact that I love the most.

I like to describe myself as among the most casual of gamers; most games that are popular with my friends don't really interest me, and I struggle to play sometimes with fatigue easily coming not long after I begin playing (usually around half an hour!). There's an exceptional list of games, though, that appears to transcend barrier somehow, and thinking about it now, I'm interested to learn more about what parts of them speak out to me the most.

Could it be the countless of hours spent spent by the developers to build the worlds I've come to love? Is it the characters in the games, and how they interact with each other and their environments? I can't say for sure right now. To me, it feels like one of those things that come intuitively: something (or some things) in the game just _vibe_ well with you, and you grow to love it or them the more you play.

It's hard for me to define what kind of games I love. Simply describing a genre won't do, since I've yet to explore any in great detail, but I can still say that a few stood out to me. More importantly, some might even have left an impact on me, usually emotionally, and challenged me to reflect and change for the better.

It sounds like a far reach saying this — after all, they're just games — but I certainly value the things I take away from the games I've played. On top of that, I really value the emotional impact games can have on me. It can feel like Schrödinger's emotion after finishing a game: when I sit in silence after finishing a game that left a mark on me, it simultaneously feels _meh_ and profound at the same time, until I figure out which one it is. That's pretty interesting to me!

Here's a list of games that have really left some kind of impact on me. I'm not the best at translating my inner feelings felt from these games into words on a screen, but I think they're an exciting avenue to describe and discover just what about these games really connects with me. Each of these games are ones that found me at the right time, where I've found myself at the right headspace to fully enjoy the games and what they have to offer.

OMORI deceivingly hides a powerful story so out of left field when you consider its otherwise innocent and happy-go-lucky art style. I doubt a game meant for everyone, especially with the dark themes that lay within (<Spoiler title="potential spoiler:">particularly surrounding isolation and psychological responses to past trauma</Spoiler>) and the game's snail pace progression. Although it took me a while to push through the first few hours of the game meant to familiarise myself with basic mechanics, the game quickly unveiled its true nature, layer by layer, as more of the worlds opened up.

I first played OMORI in 2020, though I can't exactly recall how I came across it to begin with. The game gave me such a deep insight into what it meant to convey such a complicated and morally complex message in the form of game media, and I still recall how it felt as I pieced the story and message together. There's a part in the game where, after many ambiguous moments and vague metaphors (<Spoiler title={null}>the SOMETHINGS you see</Spoiler>, the mild jump scares) it suddenly gets straight to the point and lays everything out for you. That abrupt change, to me, captured the essence of the game: storytelling done right.

The most memorable thing that still hits me to this day is OMORI's soundtrack. It ties in so well with the story, and it's so powerful that playing a G and then a C major is enough to send memories rushing back and shivers down your neck. If you were listening to the soundtrack raw with no knowledge whatsoever of the game, you'd be bewildered at the range, including things like:

- comforting nostalgia with [_See You Tomorrow_](https://youtu.be/MQYmjpdA_Pw?si=4hhFIL3_6NoECA_D) and [_Lost Library_](https://youtu.be/31jhk_A3mYk?si=bvXsD3WaOjKAiWX3)
- bone-chilling horror with [_Acrophobia_](https://youtu.be/wMfwS3xsH0s?si=L8qH6TXDxU_vohRb) and [_Friends._](https://youtu.be/FT4cMYqiOng?si=9PPFGdC-TBoYzTsa)
- certified bangers with [_World's End Valentine_](https://youtu.be/rlQd9qWKjLM?si=2MTkAPGSZTYXgMkW) and [_BREADY STEADY GO_](https://youtu.be/QL_MA9kQ-0o?si=EMDpu2DJrgpKbXEc)
- and heart-moving masterpieces with [_Dear Little Brother..._](https://youtu.be/t3b52Z2qtfw?si=I2dvw0s6eWt1Ko5Y) and [_Remembrance._](https://youtu.be/4f1v9u2Jbg8?si=DomCixYTSQygdEqS)

Also, not to forget are (arguably) the biggest tracks of the game: [_DUET_](https://youtu.be/8ya9EhvcNsA?si=GPgz5hxiWlXa9Gh2) and [_My Time_](https://youtu.be/FdmELnpjTpw?si=1Rh3EfiqkEs97zhl). How the game weaves its soundtrack throughout moments of the game and effortlessly creates strong mental associations between moments should be worthy of scientific research.

I like what [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OMORI/comments/s1a2j5/what_makes_final_duet_so_emotional_analysis) had to say about _DUET_:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

<blockquote>
  We associate this theme <Spoiler title={null} showIcon={false}>not just with Mari and Sunny’s younger life when they were happy before the trauma, but we also associate this song with the time that we start playing the game.</Spoiler> With the story’s climax already tearing at you <i>[sic]</i> heart strings, it goes even further to make it personal. <Spoiler title={null} showIcon={false}>And when you finish the game, hearing a different variation of the theme in the main menu screen, it really emphasizes an end of a difficult journey (consider it an end of the player’s journey) and the beginning of Sunny moving forward.</Spoiler>
</blockquote>

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

With a god-tier soundtrack and meticulously well-paced story, OMORI is one of those games that feel harrowing as they are such powerful foods for thought. What happened to the characters is an exception in life, and how they each handled and reacted shaped the people they eventually will become in the game. It's interesting to see how the game is just as psychological as it is enjoyable, and that's why this game has been on my mind for years now. I only wish that I could play this game for the first time again.
