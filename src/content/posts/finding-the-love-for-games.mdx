  This post will probably be updated regularly as I play more games and
  understand how I approach them more. Enjoy it as you see it now, it might
  change in the future!

People say that playing games can sometimes make you feel like a kid again, and I don't disagree with that at all. But sometimes, it can leave such a powerful impact on you that it changes you — whether for the better (like learning something about yourself) or worse (spiralling into a short-term game addiction), it's the games that leave these kinds of impact that I love the most.

I like to describe myself as the most casual of gamers out there; most games are not of my interest, and I struggle to play sometimes with fatigue easily coming no more than half an hour since I've started playing a game. But these games seem to transcend that somehow, and thinking about it now, I'm interested to learn more about what parts of them seem to speak out to me the most.

Could it be the countless of hours spent to build the worlds I've come to love? Is it the characters in the games, and how they interact with their environments? I can't say for sure. To me, it feels like one of those things that are hit and miss and come intuitively: something(s) in the game just _vibe_ with you, and you grow to love it the more you play.

It's hard for me to define what kind of games I love. Simply describing a genre won't do, since I've yet to explore any in so much detail, but I can still say that a specific few stood out to me. More importantly, some might even have left some kind of impact on me, whether emotionally or mentally, and challenged me to reflect and change for the better.

Sounds like a lot of nerdspeak, but what fun is a game without something for you to take away? And for me, I really value the emotional impact games can have. It can feel like a Schrödinger's emotion after finishing a game: it's either sitting in silence feeling _meh_ about it, sitting in silence feeling a weight from the game imprinting on you, any combination in between where it's simultaneously both at the same time until you properly think about it. It's pretty interesting to me!

Here's a list of games that have really left some kind of impact on me. I'm really bad at translating the feelings I've felt into words, but I'll do my best. Each of these games are likely examples of games that found me at the right time, where I've found myself at the right headspace to fully enjoy the games at my best. And that's cool!

I'm not sure if there's a pattern that runs amongst these games. If you see any, feel free to shout it out and let me know. Right now, I'm pretty clueless about what I like in games — including the kind of genre that speaks out to me. I'm still exploring, okay?
