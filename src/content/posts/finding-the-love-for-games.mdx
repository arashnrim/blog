People say that playing games can sometimes make you feel like a kid again, and I don't disagree with that at all. Even by bringing you back to a time of nostalgic fun, it can leave such a powerful impact on you that it changes you; whether for the better (like learning something about yourself) or worse (spiralling into a short-term game addiction), it's the games that leave this kind of impact that I love the most.

I like to describe myself as among the most casual of gamers; most games that are popular with my friends don't really interest me, and I struggle to play sometimes with fatigue easily coming not long after I begin playing (usually around half an hour!). There's an exceptional list of games, though, that appears to transcend barrier somehow, and thinking about it now, I'm interested to learn more about what parts of them speak out to me the most.

Could it be the countless of hours spent spent by the developers to build the worlds I've come to love? Is it the characters in the games, and how they interact with each other and their environments? I can't say for sure right now. To me, it feels like one of those things that come intuitively: something (or some things) in the game just _vibe_ well with you, and you grow to love it or them the more you play.

It's hard for me to define what kind of games I love. Simply describing a genre won't do, since I've yet to explore any in great detail, but I can still say that a few stood out to me. More importantly, some might even have left an impact on me, usually emotionally, and challenged me to reflect and change for the better.

It sounds like a far reach saying this — after all, they're just games — but I certainly value the things I take away from the games I've played. On top of that, I really value the emotional impact games can have on me. It can feel like Schrödinger's emotion after finishing a game: when I sit in silence after finishing a game that left a mark on me, it simultaneously feels _meh_ and profound at the same time, until I figure out which one it is. That's pretty interesting to me!

Here's a list of games that have really left some kind of impact on me. I'm not the best at translating my inner feelings felt from these games into words on a screen, but I think they're an exciting avenue to describe and discover just what about these games really connects with me. Each of these games are ones that found me at the right time, where I've found myself at the right headspace to fully enjoy the games and what they have to offer.
